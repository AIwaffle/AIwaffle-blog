[Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) is an AI RTS programming competition where competitors design and program bots to compete against each other in a programming competition.

>“Battlecode is a real-time strategy game, for which you will write an AI player. Your AI player will need to strategically manage a robot army and control how your robots work together to defeat the enemy team. As a contestant, you will learn to use artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and communications to make your player as competitive as possible.” 

Each year, teams worldwide compete to win prizes, or simply for the game itself.

We are two highschool students from China who competed in [Battlehack](http://bh2020.battlecode.org/) (A short version of Battlecode from the same organizer) as Team IDIOT, finishing in top 4. [**Match video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0TO_QtgmI)
