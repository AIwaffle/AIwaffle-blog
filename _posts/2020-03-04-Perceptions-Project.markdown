# Perceptions Project

![Perceptions Logo](../assets/images/2020-03-04-Perceptions-Project/Perceptions_logo.jpg)

Hi, my name is Kevin Li, a high school senior in New Hampshire, U.S. and a member of the AIwaffle team. I am always interested in the intersection between technology, language, art, and history. Let me start with a traditional tale to introduce my work on Perceptions. On a snowy day 6000 years ago, a man was hunting in the forest. He traced the animal footprints in the snow to look for prey. Suddenly, an idea that had been lingering deep inside his mind flashed a light. He was a knowledgeable historian of his tribe and had been thinking about how to record things like wars and the number of livestock so they can remain consistent long after humans’ memory falters. Inspired by the footprints in the snow, the historian constructed the first Han (Chinese) character called the Oracle characters and since then the language has grown to include 60,000 characters and sophisticated phrases and expressions made from those characters.

Even though the creation story is a legend, writings did originate from humans’ perception of the world and the objects within it. Besides speaking and listening, writings and readings have been one of the most lasting and important ways for humans to communicate, share, and store knowledge.

Today after 6000 years, another perception started taking form and assisted or sometimes replaced humans’ perception of the world. Computer vision has improved our lives through facial recognition that unlocks our phones and detects criminals, image classification that categorizes our favorite photos and sorts through trash for recycling, and image processing that enables visual searching of unfamiliar objects and scenes.

To most people, however, the machine’s perception of the world is usually enclosed in a mystical black box. In this exhibition, I want to show you how the machine sees the world by generating images directly from the image recognition algorithm. Moreover, I intend to compare and contrast how humans see the world 6000 years ago by displaying both the original Oracle characters and the machine-generated images. The subjects I picked, like animals and tools, largely remained the same throughout the 6000 years so the comparison is more relevant. You as the viewer will provide the third view — how humans see the world today. You will observe how perceptions change with time and hopefully find connections between how machines see the world, how your human predecessors saw the world, and how you see the world.

## Fun Task
There are 3 columns, each representing the same 7 objects in different orders.
Your task is to find the same objects in 3 columns and connect them.
